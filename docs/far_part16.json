Normally, effective price competition results in realistic pricing, and a fixed-price contract is\nordinarily in the Government\u2019s interest.\n(b) Price analysis. Price analysis, with or without competition, may provide a basis for selecting the contract type. The\ndegree to which price analysis can provide a realistic pricing standard should be carefully considered. (See 15.404-1(b).)\n(c) Cost analysis. In the absence of effective price competition and if price analysis is not sufficient, the cost estimates\nof the offeror and the Government provide the bases for negotiating contract pricing arrangements. It is essential that the\nuncertainties involved in performance and their possible impact upon costs be identified and evaluated, so that a contract type\nthat places a reasonable degree of cost responsibility upon the contractor can be negotiated.\n(d) Type and complexity of the requirement. Complex requirements, particularly those unique to the Government, usually\nresult in greater risk assumption by the Government. This is especially true for complex research and development contracts,\nwhen performance uncertainties or the likelihood of changes makes it difficult to estimate performance costs in advance.

The cost-plus-incentive-fee contract is a cost-reimbursement contract that provides for the initially\nnegotiated fee to be adjusted later by a formula based on the relationship of total allowable costs to total target costs. This\ncontract type specifies a target cost, a target fee, minimum and maximum fees, and a fee adjustment formula. After contract\nperformance, the fee payable to the contractor is determined in accordance with the formula. The formula provides, within\nlimits, for increases in fee above target fee when total allowable costs are less than target costs, and decreases in fee below\ntarget fee when total allowable costs exceed target costs. This increase or decrease is intended to provide an incentive for the\ncontractor to manage the contract effectively. When total allowable cost is greater than or less than the range of costs within\nwhich the fee-adjustment formula operates, the contractor is paid total allowable costs, plus the minimum or maximum fee.\n(b) Application. (1) A cost-plus-incentive-fee contract is appropriate for services or development and test programs when-\n(i) A cost-reimbursement contract is necessary (see 16.301-2); and\n(ii) A target cost and a fee adjustment formula can be negotiated that are likely to motivate the contractor to manage\neffectively.\n(2) The contract may include technical performance incentives when it is highly probable that the required development\nof a major system is feasible and the Government has established its performance objectives, at least in general terms. This\napproach also may apply to other acquisitions, if the use of both cost and technical performance incentives is desirable and\nadministratively practical.\n(3) The fee adjustment formula should provide an incentive that will be effective over the full range of r"
