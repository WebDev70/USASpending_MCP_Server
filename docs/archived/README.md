# Archived Documentation

This directory contains documentation files that have been archived for historical reference or are no longer actively maintained.

## Files

### GEMINI.md
- **Archived**: November 13, 2025
- **Reason**: Duplicate AI assistant context file. CLAUDE.md is the authoritative version.
- **Status**: This file is no longer maintained. Use CLAUDE.md for project context.
- **Note**: Both files contained identical project information, creating maintenance burden.

### FUTURE_RECOMMENDATIONS.md
- **Archived**: November 13, 2025
- **Reason**: Outdated recommendations document from October 31, 2025.
- **Status**: Many recommendations have since been implemented (as of November 2025).
- **Historical Interest**: Kept as reference for what improvements were identified and later implemented.
- **Note**: Recommendations like retry logic and rate limiting are now complete. See `docs/guides/RATE_LIMITING_AND_RETRY_GUIDE.md` for current implementation details.
