Such actions shall be taken before award.\n14.407-2 Apparent clerical mistakes.\n(a) Any clerical mistake, apparent on its face in the bid, may be corrected by the contracting officer before award. The\ncontracting officer first shall obtain from the bidder a verification of the bid intended. Examples of apparent mistakes are-\n(1) Obvious misplacement of a decimal point;\n(2) Obviously incorrect discounts (for example, 1 percent 10 days, 2 percent 20 days, 5 percent 30 days);\n(3) Obvious reversal of the price f.o.b. destination and price f.o.b. origin; and\n(4) Obvious mistake in designation of unit.\n(b) Correction of the bid shall be effected by attaching the verification to the original bid and a copy of the verification to\nthe duplicate bid. Correction shall not be made on the face of the bid; however, it shall be reflected in the award document.\n(c) Correction of bids submitted by electronic data interchange shall be effected by including in the electronic solicitation\nfile the original bid, the verification request, and the bid verification.\n14.407-3 Other mistakes disclosed before award.\nIn order to minimize delays in contract awards, administrative determinations may be made as described in this 14.407-3\nin connection with mistakes in bids alleged after opening of bids and before award. The authority to permit correction of bids\nis limited to bids that, as submitted, are responsive to the invitation and may not be used to permit correction of bids to make\nthem responsive.

Award shall not be made until all required approvals have been obtained and the award\notherwise conforms with 14.103-2.\n(b) If less than three bids have been received, the contracting officer shall examine the situation to ascertain the reasons for\nthe small number of responses. Award shall be made notwithstanding the limited number of bids. However, the contracting\nofficer shall initiate, if appropriate, corrective action to increase competition in future solicitations for the same or similar\nitems, and include a notation of such action in the records of the invitation for bids (see 14.204).\n(c) (1) Award shall be made by mailing or otherwise furnishing a properly executed award document to the successful\nbidder.\n(2) When a notice of award is issued, it shall be followed as soon as possible by the formal award.\n(3) When more than one award results from any single invitation for bids, separate award documents shall be suitably\nnumbered and executed.\n(4) When an award is made to a bidder for less than all of the items that may be awarded to that bidder and additional\nitems are being withheld for subsequent award, the award shall state that the Government may make subsequent awards on\nthose additional items within the bid acceptance period.\n(5) All provisions of the invitation for bids, including any acceptable additions or changes made by a bidder in the bid,\nshall be clearly and accurately set forth (either expressly or by reference) in the award document.

    "content": "Two-step sealed bidding is a combination of competitive procedures designed to obtain the benefits of sealed bidding\nwhen adequate specifications are not available. An objective is to permit the development of a sufficiently descriptive and\nnot unduly restrictive statement of the Government\u2019s requirements, including an adequate technical data package, so that\nsubsequent acquisitions may be made by conventional sealed bidding. This method is especially useful in acquisitions\nrequiring technical proposals, particularly those for complex items. It is conducted in two steps:\n(a) Step one consists of the request for, submission, evaluation, and (if necessary) discussion of a technical proposal.\nNo pricing is involved. The objective is to determine the acceptability of the supplies or services offered. As used in this\ncontext, the word \"technical\" has a broad connotation and includes, among other things, the engineering approach, special\nmanufacturing processes, and special testing techniques. It is the proper step for clarification of questions relating to technical\nrequirements. Conformity to the technical requirements is resolved in this step, but not responsibility as defined in 9.1.\n(b) Step two involves the submission of sealed priced bids by those who submitted acceptable technical proposals in step\none. Bids submitted in step two are evaluated and the awards made in accordance with subparts 14.3 and 14.4."
