Taking into consideration the advisory recommendations, reports of contributing\nspecialists, and the current status of the contractor\u2019s purchasing system, the contracting officer is responsible for exercising\nthe requisite judgment needed to reach a negotiated settlement with the offeror and is solely responsible for the final price\nagreement. However, when significant audit or other specialist recommendations are not adopted, the contracting officer\nshould provide rationale that supports the negotiation result in the price negotiation documentation.\n(b) The contracting officer\u2019s primary concern is the overall price the Government will actually pay. The contracting\nofficer\u2019s objective is to negotiate a contract of a type and with a price providing the contractor the greatest incentive for\nefficient and economical performance.
